# Par-king
Parking management application created using Java and JFace/SWT

This is a project created as an assignment for an Object-Oriented Programming module. 
It began as a simple desktop parking management system which implemented a GUI to manage and see the parking spots and their availability,
but in the process of development more complex features were added.

The application runs a server on which a client application can send packages via a TCP connection and change the status of the parking spots. The messages are filtered accordingly. This project is hereby a prototype for an application that could work with ground sensors for a 24/7 self-monitoring parking lot, where availability of every spot is known at all times.

Features:
Parking Lot/Zones/Spots visual representation
Capacity meter
Reset button
Select zone button
Lot settings button
Functional server implementation

This project was my first contact with - among other things - multithreading, custom events, eventListeners and eventHandlers, TCP client/server communication and message filtering.   

I am thrilled to upload this, since I have basically finished the application, and only some final touches remain to be added. This was the product of one exhausting but incredibly rewarding week.
